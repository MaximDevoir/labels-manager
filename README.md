## Versioning

### When changing application permissions

Bump the major version when changes are made to application permissions. Users
need to either accept the permission updates or reinstall the application.

**Always fill out the description of changes** at the bottom of the permissions
change. I've noticed I haven't been notified in my applications if the
permissions are updated without a reason specified.
